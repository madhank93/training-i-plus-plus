Behavior Driven Development is a software development approach that allows the tester or business analyst to create test cases in simple text language.


BDD is a process designed to aid the management and the delivery of software development projects by improving communication between engineers and business professionals. It ensures all development projects remain focused on delivering what the business actually needs while meeting all requirements of the user.
