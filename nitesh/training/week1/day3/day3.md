## SCM (Source Code Management)

Source code management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. SCM is also synonymous with Version control.

### Source code management best practices

#### Commit often

Commits should be made frequently to capture updates to a code base. Each commit is a snapshot that the codebase can be reverted to if needed.

#### Ensure you're working from latest version

SCM enables rapid updates from multiple developers. Make sure to git pull or fetch the latest code before making updates. This will help avoid conflicts at merge time.

#### Make detailed notes

It is important to leave descriptive explanatory commit log messages. These commit log messages should explain the “why” and “what” that encompass the commits content.

#### Review changes before committing

SCM’s offer a ‘staging area’. The staging area can be used to collect a group of edits before writing them to a commit.

#### Use Branches

Branching is a powerful SCM mechanism that allows developers to create a separate line of development. Branches should be used frequently as they are quick and inexpensive. Branches enable multiple developers to work in parallel on separate lines of development.

#### Agree on a Workflow

By default SCMs offer very free form methods of contribution. It is important that teams establish shared patterns of collaboration. SCM workflows establish patterns and processes for merging branches.
