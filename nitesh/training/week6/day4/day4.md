Microservice Architecture is an architectural development style which builds an application as a collection of small autonomous services developed for a business domain.

### Advantages of microservices

Technology diversity, e., Microservices can mix easily with other frameworks, libraries, and databases
Fault isolation, e., a process failure should not bring the whole system down.
Greater support for smaller and parallel team
Independent deployment
Deployment time reduce

### Challenges faced while using Microservices

Microservices always rely on each other. Therefore, they need to communicate with each other.
As it is distributed system, it is a heavily involved model.
If you are using Microservice architecture, you need to ready for operations overhead.
You need skilled professionals to support heterogeneously distributed microservices.

### In Microservice architecture tests are divided into three broad categories:

- At the bottom level test, we can perform a general test like performance and unit tests. These kinds of tests are entirely automated.
- At the middle level, we can perform exploratory tests like the stress tests and usability tests.
- At the top level, we can conduct acceptance tests which are mostly fewer in numbers. It also helps stakeholders to know about different software features.

### OAuth

OAuth means open authorization protocol. This protocol allows you to access the client applications on HTTP for third-party providers GitHub, Facebook, etc. It helps you to share resources stored on one site with another site without the need for their credentials.
