/*
vcard.go: Define a struct Address and a struct VCard. The latter contains a
personâ€™s name, a number of addresses, a birth date, a photo. Try to find the right
data types. Make your own vcard and print its contents.
Hint: VCard must contain addresses, will they be included as values or as pointers ?
The 2nd choice is better, consuming less memory. So an Address struct with a name
and two pointers to addresses could be printed out with %v as:
{Kersschot 0x126d2b80 0x126d2be0}
