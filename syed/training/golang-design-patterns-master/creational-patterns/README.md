# Creational Design Patterns

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)
**creational design patterns** deal with object creation mechanisms. They
creates objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

They aim to separate a system from how its objects are created, composed, and
represented. They increase the system's flexibility in terms of the what, who,
how, and when of object creation. Creational patterns encapsulate the knowledge
about which classes a system uses, but they hide the details of how the
instances of these classes are created and put together.
