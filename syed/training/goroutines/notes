What are Goroutines?
Goroutines are functions or methods that run concurrently with other functions or methods. 
Goroutines can be thought of as lightweight threads. 
The cost of creating a Goroutine is tiny when compared to a thread.
 Hence it's common for Go applications to have thousands of Goroutines running concurrently.
